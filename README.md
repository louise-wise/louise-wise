👋 Hi, I’m @louise-wise
📚 Author of sci-fi, romcoms, and everything in between.
🌐 Learning the ropes of digital marketing (slowly, painfully).
🤝 Keen to connect and collaborate with fellow indie authors—especially those who actually want to share, not just shout into the void.
📩 Reach me at: info@louisewise.uk
😄 Pronouns? Let’s not.
🧠 Fun fact: I think we’re all living in a simulation—and no, I’m not joking.
